# Exercises

## Part 1: How to do OO in C#

In these exercises we will learn the C# syntax and rules for object orientation in C# by building up an application.

If you are not very familiar with OO, you may not finish this section.

### 1.1: Classes & Objects

### 1.2: Inheritance

### 1.3: Interfaces

### 1.4: Polymorphism

## Part 2: Object Model Design with OO

In this section you will put your knowledge of OO syntax into practice by designing and implementing an object hierarchy in C#.

This is a more open-ended section which has no right or wrong answers but requires you to weigh up different design options and consider how well they would work as part of a larger system.

### 2.1: Class Hierarchy Design

Design and implement a class hierarchy representing a simple banking system which allows money to be stored, spent and transferred in different ways.

Consider the different forms money can take, for example cash, credit cards and vouchers, and the different properties of those.

Think about different currencies and how the ability to store and/or pay in different ones affects the model.

The result of this exercise should be an object model implemented in C# which uses inheritance and other OO features as approproate, which could be used by banking services.  If you have time, demonstrate the use of your classes as well, for example with a console application or unit tests.
